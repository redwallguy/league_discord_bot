Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2. 5 seconds channel that, upon completion, places the monsters within a grove . Placing a grove costs 192 - 248 (based on level) health and 149 - 111 (based on level) mana , and cannot be cast if Ivern lacks the resources. The grove matures over 40 - 6 (based on level) seconds. When fully matured, Ivern can interact with the camp again to instantly free the monsters, sending them away while receiving their full gold and full experience bounties . Smiting a camp within a grove will instantly free the monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monsters' current health. If the camp's large monster has already been slain, Ivern will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain. Starting at level 5, freeing the Red Brambleback or the Blue Sentinel leaves behind a sapling that can be picked up by an allied champion to gain the camp's buff, consuming it in the process.
